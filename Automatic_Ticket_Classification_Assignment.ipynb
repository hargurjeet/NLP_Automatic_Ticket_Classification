            "11    On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n",

              "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",
