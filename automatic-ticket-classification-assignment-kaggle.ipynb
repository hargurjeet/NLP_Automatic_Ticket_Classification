By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n\nYou will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n\n* Credit card / Prepaid card\n\n* Bank account services\n\n* Theft/Dispute reporting\n\n* Mortgages/loans\n\n* Others\n\n\nWith the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.","metadata":{"id":"rhR-ZUkwJrFn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pipelines that needs to be performed:\n\nYou need to perform the following eight major tasks to complete the assignment:\n\n1.

However, fraudulent application have been submitted my identity without my consent to fraudulently obtain services. Do not extend credit without verifying the identity of the applicant.\n11    On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n14

rewards card i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error\n14

rewards card i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n14

for well over a decade was offered multiple solicitations for acquiring new credit cards with chase all with bonus airline miles and hotel points was approved for all new cards with no annual fee for year after less than months with payment always paid as agreed chase closed all my cards one of my approved new cards was never activated but was sent to me chase has done harm to my credit has charged me an annual fee even though they cancelled my account failed to credit my points for both airlines and hotel failed to credit up to for xxxx enrollment and failed to credit airline charge as agreed upon   \n78309                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called chas my xxxx xxxx visa credit card provider and asked how to make a claim under their purchase protection benefit on xxxxxxxx i purchased three high school textbooks for my xxxx year old daughter because she transferred to a new school all three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke the chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at xxxx i immediately went to the website and filed the claim including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage the website even had books as one of the catagories i could list as the type of item they cover and that i could make a claim on after following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to review my information and contact me within business days to outline the next steps of the process as outlined in an email i received acknowledging my claim submission i called to complain the representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner for eight to ten days and then it would take two days to actually review the claim i responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email xxxx sent to me and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works i then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one i was then put on hold and when she returned she said my file had just been updated while i was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end i explained that my daughter s course had not ended and that i was told specifically by chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim by the time the call ended i received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied i find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent   \n78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n78311

i have had flawless credit for yrs ive had chase credit cards chase freedom specifically since xxxx with no problems ever ive done many balance transfers in my life so i have plenty of experience i recently did a balance transfer with chase freedom for did many with other chase cards but apparently not freeedom when i got my first bill my minimum payment was i was shocked i immediately called on xxxxxxxx the representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the balance transfer fee up front but my future payments would be around of total balance which is standard and the rate they advertise i went to pay the next payment on xxxxxxxx was once again shocked to see my minimum payment was i paid it but i have been trying to work this out with chase ever since apparently the representative was wrong i am actually expected to pay instead of the standard they normally charge bc that was written in my user agreement paperwork back in xxxxxxxx years ago they currently charge to everyone else in the world my other cards including chase are all this is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for credit card i have kids many other bills to pay they never warned me they were so off the charts with their minimum payment percentage except for my original paperwork in xxxxxxxx they offer everyone else terms they change their terms anytime it benefits them but wont budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable reasonable so i also asked them as soon as i found this out to refund my transfer fee so i could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment they refused i also asked if they would transfer to my chase slate card which has min pmt they also refused they will not work with me at all i am a responsible working person i would like to preserve my good credit i could easily transfer again to a different card but id have to pay another lump sum of again   \n78312

in order to close out an unsecured line of credit i had to pay it off i did that to close out my account roughly payment when i closed out the accounts and now i get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after years stating i owe close to dollars i have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the years because i paid it off upon calling them i am told i need to show proof i paid it off i would like to think that if indeed i had not paid it off which i did i would have immediately received late payment notifications i left chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions   \n\n

explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only get applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i wa glad i got denied and i wa absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i wa told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on

on xxxxxxxx i purchased three high school textbook for my xxxx year old daughter because she transferred to a new school all three book were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke the chase representative assured me the textbook would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at xxxx i immediately went to the website and filed the claim including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement copy of the three receipt and photographic evidence of the damage the website even had book a one of the catagories i could list a the type of item they cover and that i could make a claim on after following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to review my information and contact me within business day to outline the next step of the process a outlined in an email i received acknowledging my claim submission i called to complain the representative said claim are not looked at by an examiner for eight to ten day and then it would take two day to actually review the claim i responded that this information wa contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email xxxx sent to me and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it work i then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one i wa then put on hold and when she returned she said my file had just been updated while i wa on hold and that the claim wa being denied because textbook have finite life and are undergo revision after course end i explained that my daughter s course had not ended and that i wa told specifically by chase that my textbook purchase would be covered and wa again told they were refusing my claim by the time the call ended i received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and wa being denied i find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent   \n78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it wa through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n78311

specifically since xxxx with no problem ever ive done many balance transfer in my life so i have plenty of experience i recently did a balance transfer with chase freedom for did many with other chase card but apparently not freeedom when i got my first bill my minimum payment wa i wa shocked i immediately called on xxxxxxxx the representative told me that the min payment wa so high bc they were making me pay the balance transfer fee up front but my future payment would be around of total balance which is standard and the rate they advertise i went to pay the next payment on xxxxxxxx wa once again shocked to see my minimum payment wa i paid it but i have been trying to work this out with chase ever since apparently the representative wa wrong i am actually expected to pay instead of the standard they normally charge bc that wa written in my user agreement paperwork back in xxxxxxxx year ago they currently charge to everyone else in the world my other card including chase are all this is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for credit card i have kid many other bill to pay they never warned me they were so off the chart with their minimum payment percentage except for my original paperwork in xxxxxxxx they offer everyone else term they change their term anytime it benefit them but wont budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable reasonable so i also asked them a soon a i found this out to refund my transfer fee so i could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment they refused i also asked if they would transfer to my chase slate card which ha min pmt they also refused they will not work with me at all i am a responsible working person i would like to preserve my good credit i could easily transfer again to a different card but id have to pay another lump sum of again   \n78312

roughly year ago i closed out my account with jp morgan chase bank xxxx in order to close out an unsecured line of credit i had to pay it off i did that to close out my account roughly payment when i closed out the account and now i get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after year stating i owe close to dollar i have never had any payment schedule or notification in the year because i paid it off upon calling them i am told i need to show proof i paid it off i would like to think that if indeed i had not paid it off which i did i would have immediately received late payment notification i left chase bank because of some poor customer service and charge that were way out of line with the other banking institution   \n\n

Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised technique so there are no labeling of topics that the model will be trained on. The way it works is that, NMF decomposes (or factorizes) high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional representation. These lower-dimensional vectors are non-negative which also means their coefficients are non-negative.\n\nIn this task you have to perform the following:\n\n* Find the best number of clusters\n* Apply the best number to create word clusters\n* Inspect & validate the correction of each cluster wrt the complaints\n* Correct the labels if needed\n* Map the clusters to topics/cluster names","metadata":{"id":"7Q9lwvNEJrGB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.decomposition import NMF","metadata":{"id":"amLT4omWJrGB","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-14T00:07:29.126660Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-14T00:07:29.127419Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-14T00:07:29.220142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-14T00:07:29.127382Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-14T00:07:29.218429Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Manual Topic Modeling\nYou need to do take the trial & error approach to find the best num of topics for your NMF model.\n\nThe only parameter that is required is the number of components i.e. the number of topics we want.

immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to

points which are worth at least around months ago when i tried to access my chase ultimate rewards account or even activate the bonus on chase freedom i would get shown this page that says we are unable to complete your request at this time image attached as well xxxx xxxx at first i thought it was just a temporary error which isnt uncommon for chase but after weeks this was still happening so i called customer support they opened a ticket got escalated to their tech team but when i would call back to find out what happened they told me that the case had been closed this happened times and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information going from ultimaterewardscom and chasecom have the same result im not able to use these points by phone either because the operators for the travel center are not able to access my accountpoints neither ive tried every browser both xxxx and xxxx computers and the xxxx chase phone application they all send me to the page that says we are unable to complete your request at this time on xxxxxxxx i looked up some people that work in ultimate rewards on xxxx and cold called a vp of customer relations he acted like he was helpful at first and we exchanged some emails he eventually said i can buy a flighthotel using chase sapphire and if i give him the details he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase long story short he wasnt able to fix anything i can see that im still collecting points but i havent been able to access it i travel a lot and its become a huge inconvenience that im not able to access these points which i intended to use for travel i need to get this issue resolved asap   \n15

innocuous title important information regarding changes to your chase account they often use similar titles for ads and other communications in it they force me into binding arbitration despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them they do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out this is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out this is blatant malpractice by chase   \n10

be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n23

savings account and the other user on my account i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user customer rep told me they would call me back in minutes to keep the line open i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my xxxx xxxx card to pay for the order xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and xxxx xxxx was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for hours called caterer card declined use a mastercard which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the transaction never been declined by either chase or xxxx xxxx before today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear it never did   \n86

happened back in though i have made numerous attempts to contact them they do not respond and they tell me know one works in that department any more so there is no one to contact because of this instead of saying sold on my credit report it shows that i am very behind on payments and it is hurting my credit i have called them and mailed letter and no response   \n58

the closing date was xxxxxxxx please see attached statement that statement xxxxxxxx shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx however when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully xxxx

this info they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx   \n27

customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this

attempt to have this fraudulent inquiry removed i was told that i need to call and contact the original creditor that placed this inquiry on my report i have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me they seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts i have made nobody seems to understand what im talkin about i want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before i take legal action i i have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them i have an iquiry from i want this matter resolved   \n21  on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n14

ago when i tried to access my chase ultimate reward account or even activate the bonus on chase freedom i would get shown this page that say we are unable to complete your request at this time image attached a well xxxx xxxx at first i thought it wa just a temporary error which isnt uncommon for chase but after week this wa still happening so i called customer support they opened a ticket got escalated to their tech team but when i would call back to find out what happened they told me that the case had been closed this happened time and each call ha taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information going from ultimaterewardscom and chasecom have the same result im not able to use these point by phone either because the operator for the travel center are not able to access my accountpoints neither ive tried every browser both xxxx and xxxx computer and the xxxx chase phone application they all send me to the page that say we are unable to complete your request at this time on xxxxxxxx i looked up some people that work in ultimate reward on xxxx and cold called a vp of customer relation he acted like he wa helpful at first and we exchanged some email he eventually said i can buy a flighthotel using chase sapphire and if i give him the detail he will deduct the appropriate point and credit my credit card for the purchase long story short he wasnt able to fix anything i can see that im still collecting point but i havent been able to access it i travel a lot and it become a huge inconvenience that im not able to access these point which i intended to use for travel i need to get this issue resolved asap   \n15

today with the innocuous title important information regarding change to your chase account they often use similar title for ad and other communication in it they force me into binding arbitration despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them they do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequence many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out this is clearly le secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out this is blatant malpractice by chase   \n10

card i put in my information for the offer and within le than a minute wa notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and wa referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i wa told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application wa denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only get applied after the first account statement and could not be used

                       i made a purchase of on xxxxxxxx i made payment of on xxxxxxxx and on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment wa the closing date wa xxxxxxxx please see attached statement that statement xxxxxxxx show that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous month statement to show that there were no other purchase prior to the one on xxxxxxxx however when i got the xxxx statement it show that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance wa a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase wa applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment ha been met payment in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase ha skirted u financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ear at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n20

                                    to whom it may concern chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fee i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transaction if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guideline they dont refund more then overdrawft doesnt matter bank fault or not taken from people is money just because you can is not ok see attached document when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place   \n26

                                                  i have reached out to xxxx several time in attempt to have this fraudulent inquiry removed i wa told that i need to call and contact the original creditor that placed this inquiry on my report i have made several attempt to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that wa not authorized by me they seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempt i have made nobody seems to understand what im talkin about i want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before i take legal action i i have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them i have an iquiry from i want this matter resolved   \n21  on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n14

rewards card i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n14

                                                             on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called chas my xxxx xxxx visa credit card provider and asked how to make a claim under their purchase protection benefit on xxxxxxxx i purchased three high school textbooks for my xxxx year old daughter because she transferred to a new school all three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke the chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at xxxx i immediately went to the website and filed the claim including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage the website even had books as one of the catagories i could list as the type of item they cover and that i could make a claim on after following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to review my information and contact me within business days to outline the next steps of the process as outlined in an email i received acknowledging my claim submission i called to complain the representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner for eight to ten days and then it would take two days to actually review the claim i responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email xxxx sent to me and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works i then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one i was then put on hold and when she returned she said my file had just been updated while i was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end i explained that my daughter s course had not ended and that i was told specifically by chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim by the time the call ended i received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied i find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent   \n78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n78311

i have had flawless credit for yrs ive had chase credit cards chase freedom specifically since xxxx with no problems ever ive done many balance transfers in my life so i have plenty of experience i recently did a balance transfer with chase freedom for did many with other chase cards but apparently not freeedom when i got my first bill my minimum payment was i was shocked i immediately called on xxxxxxxx the representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the balance transfer fee up front but my future payments would be around of total balance which is standard and the rate they advertise i went to pay the next payment on xxxxxxxx was once again shocked to see my minimum payment was i paid it but i have been trying to work this out with chase ever since apparently the representative was wrong i am actually expected to pay instead of the standard they normally charge bc that was written in my user agreement paperwork back in xxxxxxxx years ago they currently charge to everyone else in the world my other cards including chase are all this is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for credit card i have kids many other bills to pay they never warned me they were so off the charts with their minimum payment percentage except for my original paperwork in xxxxxxxx they offer everyone else terms they change their terms anytime it benefits them but wont budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable reasonable so i also asked them as soon as i found this out to refund my transfer fee so i could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment they refused i also asked if they would transfer to my chase slate card which has min pmt they also refused they will not work with me at all i am a responsible working person i would like to preserve my good credit i could easily transfer again to a different card but id have to pay another lump sum of again   \n78312

in order to close out an unsecured line of credit i had to pay it off i did that to close out my account roughly payment when i closed out the accounts and now i get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after years stating i owe close to dollars i have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the years because i paid it off upon calling them i am told i need to show proof i paid it off i would like to think that if indeed i had not paid it off which i did i would have immediately received late payment notifications i left chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions   \n\n

                                                      on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called chas my xxxx xxxx visa credit card provider and asked how to make a claim under their purchase protection benefit on xxxxxxxx i purchased three high school textbook for my xxxx year old daughter because she transferred to a new school all three book were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke the chase representative assured me the textbook would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at xxxx i immediately went to the website and filed the claim including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement copy of the three receipt and photographic evidence of the damage the website even had book a one of the catagories i could list a the type of item they cover and that i could make a claim on after following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to review my information and contact me within business day to outline the next step of the process a outlined in an email i received acknowledging my claim submission i called to complain the representative said claim are not looked at by an examiner for eight to ten day and then it would take two day to actually review the claim i responded that this information wa contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email xxxx sent to me and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it work i then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one i wa then put on hold and when she returned she said my file had just been updated while i wa on hold and that the claim wa being denied because textbook have finite life and are undergo revision after course end i explained that my daughter s course had not ended and that i wa told specifically by chase that my textbook purchase would be covered and wa again told they were refusing my claim by the time the call ended i received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and wa being denied i find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent   \n78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it wa through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n78311

specifically since xxxx with no problem ever ive done many balance transfer in my life so i have plenty of experience i recently did a balance transfer with chase freedom for did many with other chase card but apparently not freeedom when i got my first bill my minimum payment wa i wa shocked i immediately called on xxxxxxxx the representative told me that the min payment wa so high bc they were making me pay the balance transfer fee up front but my future payment would be around of total balance which is standard and the rate they advertise i went to pay the next payment on xxxxxxxx wa once again shocked to see my minimum payment wa i paid it but i have been trying to work this out with chase ever since apparently the representative wa wrong i am actually expected to pay instead of the standard they normally charge bc that wa written in my user agreement paperwork back in xxxxxxxx year ago they currently charge to everyone else in the world my other card including chase are all this is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for credit card i have kid many other bill to pay they never warned me they were so off the chart with their minimum payment percentage except for my original paperwork in xxxxxxxx they offer everyone else term they change their term anytime it benefit them but wont budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable reasonable so i also asked them a soon a i found this out to refund my transfer fee so i could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment they refused i also asked if they would transfer to my chase slate card which ha min pmt they also refused they will not work with me at all i am a responsible working person i would like to preserve my good credit i could easily transfer again to a different card but id have to pay another lump sum of again   \n78312

roughly year ago i closed out my account with jp morgan chase bank xxxx in order to close out an unsecured line of credit i had to pay it off i did that to close out my account roughly payment when i closed out the account and now i get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after year stating i owe close to dollar i have never had any payment schedule or notification in the year because i paid it off upon calling them i am told i need to show proof i paid it off i would like to think that if indeed i had not paid it off which i did i would have immediately received late payment notification i left chase bank because of some poor customer service and charge that were way out of line with the other banking institution   \n\n

immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n14
